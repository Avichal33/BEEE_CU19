Circuit diagram



Theory
Concept use:-Use arduino UNO for led flasher. By use coding lights up 5 Led in row but every time speed to be increase. 

Learning and observations:-I learn to glow 5 Led in row, learn basic code concept of arduino,learn connection of circuit with arduino, and make pattern glow


Problems and Troubleshooting:-
I face problem of short wires get stuck into each other and which PC I use, in that arduino program can't uploading, and some confusion about for loop for speed. 
For wires we make circuit arrange well, we copy the program and paste it to another PC and than uploaded it well, and for confusion about speed is delay but at last I solve it. 

Precautions :-
1.Wire are not so stuck into each other, confusion can't be Crete to connecting wires to arduino.
2.wire to be correctly place as code. 
3.wires are pushed well into pins
4.Remember the positive and negative terminal of led and circuit. 
5.Chech the led well, it is fuse or not.
6.Check wire to be not curled. 

Learning and outcomes :-
1.I learn basic code well. 
2 Understand circuit. 
3.Go through basic precautions. 
4.Solve basic task. 
5.Ability to make other glow pattern for led chaser. 


Code.:-

void setup()
{
For(int i=9;i<=13;i++)
pinMode(i,OUTPUT);
}
void loop()
{
For(int j=25;j>=1;j--)
{
for(int i=9;i<=13;i++)
{
digitalWrite(i,HIGH);
delay(j*50);
digitalWrite(i,LOW);
delay(j*50);
}
}
}

Home work:-
I think about my mistake I use j loop mean for long for speed by changing delay,as I use firtly++ that time delay increases means speed decreases. 
So next time ,I make that loop in--and they delay deacrases and speed increases.
And I go through circuit again by website tnkercad and run program again.
